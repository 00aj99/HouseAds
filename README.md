# HouseAds
A simple Android library (currently in very, very early stage) to cross promote your apps!
<br/>Currently includes a Dialog & Interstitial Ad fetched from a json which is stored on a site/server.


Primary Goal:
<br/>To keep it Simple & including Ads support like AdMob's Ad (Native, Interstitial, no Banners!)

<br/>Json Schema:
